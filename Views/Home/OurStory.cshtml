                This isn’t just a page.
                It’s our story.
                And I remember every single detail.

            <p>
                It didn’t start with a “hi”.

                It started with a fire emoji on my Instagram story.

                That little 🔥 reaction.
                You probably don’t even realize it…

                But that’s where everything changed.

            <h1>The Canteen Days ☕</h1>
            <p>
                We were just two college starters.

                Seeing each other in the canteen.
                Pretending not to notice.
                But secretly noticing everything.

                Every time I saw you,
                I acted normal…

                But inside?
                Complete chaos.

            <h1>The First Meeting 🌳</h1>
            <p>
                We decided to meet.

                You came alone.
                I came alone.

                We walked just one round in the park.
                Barely talking.
                Both shy.
                Both nervous.

                The silence wasn’t awkward.
                It was loud with butterflies.

                We met for maybe 20 minutes.
                Then I said,
                “I have a lecture.”

                Truth?
                I didn’t run because of the lecture.
                I ran because I was already falling for you.

    <section>
        <div>
            <h1>The First Coffee ☕</h1>
            <p>
                After one of our exams,

                Your friends knew.
                My friends knew.
                And somehow they pushed us outside the college gate
                to that small coffee shop.

                We sat there,
                pretending to be normal.

                The coffee?
                Honestly… it was terrible.

                But we didn’t complain.
                We didn’t react.
                We just smiled.

                Because it wasn’t about the coffee.

                It was about sitting in front of you,
                knowing this was something special.

            <h1>The Letters ✉️</h1>
            <p>
                I used to think about what to say before meeting you.

                But every time I saw you,
                my mind went blank.

                So I wrote letters.

                Because on paper,
                I was brave.

                In front of you,
                I was just a shy boy
                trying not to show how much he cared.

        <div>
            <h1>The College Stairs 💋</h1>
            <p>
                And then…

                That moment.

                On the college stairs.

                Our first kiss.

                I still remember exactly how I felt.
                My heart racing.
                My hands slightly shaking.
                The world going silent.

                That feeling?
                That moment?

                It can never be recreated.
                It was pure.
                It was ours.

                And even today,
                when I think about it,
                I smile like an idiot.

            <h1>The Soda Outside College 🥤</h1>
            <p>
                There was that soda guy outside college.

                We used to go there.
                Just small things.
                Simple moments.

                But I loved them.

                Because even doing nothing with you
                felt better than doing something with anyone else.

            <p>
                Behind the college,
                there was that big water tank.

                We used to go there sometimes.

                And that railway track…

                Remember how we acted like we were trekking?
                Like explorers on some adventure?

                It was silly.
                It was random.

                But it was ours.

                Those small, stupid, happy moments
                mean more to me than anything expensive ever could.

        <div>
            <h1>From Then… To Now ❤️</h1>
            <p>
                From shy starters in the canteen…
                to awkward park walks…
                to bad coffee dates…
                to first kisses on college stairs…
                to fake trekking behind campus…

                Four years later,
                we’re still here.

                Stronger.
                Closer.
                More comfortable than ever.

                You know my fears.
                My dreams.
                My secrets.

                And I know yours.

                And that’s what makes this love real.

                Not just butterflies.
                Not just excitement.

                But understanding.
                Trust.
                Choosing each other every day.
